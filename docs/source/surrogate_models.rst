Surrogate Models
======================================================

The surrogate models in apprentice is made available through the ``SurrogateModel``
base class. Details about the ``SurrogateModel`` base class and how to construct
your own implementation of ``SurrogateModel`` base class is given in
:ref:`this tutorial<apprentice_tutorial_surrogatemodels>`. The implementations
of ``SurrogateModel`` available in apprentice include Polynomial Approximation,
Rational Approximation, and Gaussian Process. The tutorial pages pointed to by the
links below provide more details about the surrogate models as well as information of
how to construct and use these surrogate models.
